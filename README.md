# Ethertown-Polytechnic-🏛️ What Is Ethertown Polytechnic?
Ethertown Polytechnic is a fictional school for very real learning.
It’s a DIY framework for self-education — especially in tech, cybersecurity, and creative skills — built by people who are tired of bureaucracy, burned out by traditional academia, and still deeply hungry to learn.
Instead of waiting for permission or degrees, you become the architect of your own curriculum. Each course is a mix of practical task lists, hands-on labs, open-source resources, and a heavy dose of creativity and myth-making. Imagine learning Linux like it’s a spellbook. Studying networking like it’s a secret map. Or passing Security+ as if it were an initiation rite.
It’s half zine, half hacker bootcamp, half occult school, and 100% yours.
There are no grades. No gatekeeping. Just curiosity, intention, and the tools to actually build a skillset that matters — whether you want to land a job, make art, or defend the signal from the noise.

Who’s It For?
People teaching themselves tech/cybersecurity skills outside traditional channels
Neurodivergent learners, autodidacts, and creative misfits
Anyone who wants to learn deep things in weird ways
Anyone who sees knowledge as both a tool and a story

What You’ll Find:
Printable PDFs: spellbooks, task lists, course catalogs
Self-paced course tracks (like “Cyber Sigils & the Art of Defense”)
A fake but beautiful graduation certificate
ID badges, zine covers, mixtapes, and aesthetic reinforcement
Actual job-ready skills underneath it all

Why It Exists:
Because the world is too bureaucratic, too credential-obsessed, and too joyless about learning. Ethertown Polytechnic is here to re-enchant learning, reclaim your curiosity, and help you get hired, build, or explore on your own terms.

If you’re teaching yourself — you’re not alone. You’re already enrolled. 🕯️📡📘
